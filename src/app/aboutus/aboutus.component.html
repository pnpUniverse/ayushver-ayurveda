                        The Ayurvedic concepts of physiology, pathology, diagnosis, medicine and therapeutics are based on the doctrine of tridoshas: vata, pitta and kapha. They are designated as doshas because of their capacity to vitiate other doshas and also as dhatus as they support the body.

                        Rigveda (2000 BC) is the oldest recorded document regarding use of plants as medicine in India, and this tradition continued in another ancient text, Atharvaveda (1500-1000 BC), which described more plants and introduced basic concepts.

                        In 1000 BC, Punarvasu Atreya (head of the school of medicine) and Divodas Dhanvantari (head of the school of surgery) imparted knowledge and practical training to their students. The brilliant scholars of these schools faithfully documented the precepts of their masters in their compendia, popularly known as the Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita , respectively.

                        The Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita are the basic scriptures of Ayurveda, but they are supplemented by thousands of additions based on observation and experience, none of which affect the sanctity of the basic texts.
